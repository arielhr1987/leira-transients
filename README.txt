= Can I create new transients with this plugin? =  
Not yet. Currently, the plugin allows you to view, edit and delete existing transients but not create new ones.  

= What parts of a transient can I edit? =  
You can modify the **name**, **value**, and **expiration time** of a transient.  

= Will this plugin affect performance? =
