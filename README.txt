Manage WordPress transients easily with a clean, intuitive interface — view, edit, or delete them without touching code.

== Description ==

**Leira Transients** is a lightweight, developer-friendly plugin that simplifies the management of WordPress transients.  

With **Leira Transients**, you can:  
- View all registered transients in a single dashboard.  
- Edit transient **values** and **expiration times** directly from the admin.  

**Important:** This plugin is intended for users who know what they are doing or have experience in WordPress development. Modifying transient values incorrectly could break your site. Use with caution.  

This plugin is ideal for developers, site administrators, and anyone who wants full visibility and control over WordPress’s transient system — no coding required.

4. That’s it — you’re ready to go!

Not at the moment. You can view, edit, and delete existing transients, but creating new ones is not yet supported.  

= What parts of a transient can I edit? =
